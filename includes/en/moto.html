    <p> 
      A generation which renews and produces would not discard the heritage of generations. Such a generation checks and examines, from near and from afar. At times it clings to existing tradition and adds to it. At other times it digs up heaps of discards to reveal the forgotten, to remove the rust and restore to life ancient traditions which in turn sustain anew that generation's soul.
