<h1> About us</h1>
<p>In our country, there are a number of collectors of old tractors and
    agricultural equipment. The collectors are all very keen and spend a great
    deal of time and money acquiring and repairing this equipment much to
    the enhancement of their surroundings. One of the best-known collectors
    is Erez Milshtein from Ein-Vered where tractors have been collected since
    the beginning of the last century - those tractors  used by the farmers to
    redeem the country.</p>
<p>When Erez left farming he began to collect item after item discovering
    what was hidden in the beautiful scenery and the rubbish dumps of the
    moshavim, the kibbutzim and settlements. In one decade Erez has succeeded
    in saving more than a hundred items of motorized equipment and dozens of
    allied items most of which have been repaired to a mobile state or are
    still being reconstructed.</p>
